#Project X
My take on the rougelike genre.

##Background
This project started with my love for Tales of Maj'Eyal, which is an amazing rougelike rpg! I have been playing it for roughly 2 years without ever finishing the game. It is that good and unforgiving! Please check it out [here](http://te4.org/).

##Disclaimer
Most of the early commits and base version of the game is created by following the [Complete roguelike tutorial using C++ and libtcod](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_roguelike_tutorial_using_C%2B%2B_and_libtcod_-_part_1:_setting_up). I have used the 1.5.2 version of libtcod, which is incredibly hard to find so for the ease of anyone who would like to follow my footsteps or recreate his own version, I have forked it and should be reachable through my repositories. The lib folder contains the version of 1.5.2 however everything else has been updated to the last version. Inlcuded project file settings should allow you to pull, compile and run!

##Current known issues
After loading the file, Player level and dungeon level is not displayed correctly.

##Next steps
As a roadmap for the project I decided to have a server where the save files will be stored.
